# The Nagoya Ontology (NagO)#
________

### About ###

NagO is a domain ontology focused on terms regarding the United Kingdom and its external territories and their link to the Nagoya Protocol policy framework, processes and people involved. 

NagO was developed to semantically close data gaps as an exemplary proof-of-principle tool to unveil the legal relationships of the United Kingdom to its external territories and to model complex thematic connections around the Nagoya Protocol, including biodiversity, geography, administrative and constitutional terms. NagO adds these terms to the semantic network and also reveals processes behind the Nagoya policy framework. It allows for the end user not only to query for particular places of interest relating to the United Kingdom but also governmental structures and Nagoya protocol affairs. It was created to signify a first sovereignty ontology as a start for further extensions on this topic to aggregate centralized, machine-readable knowledge available for stakeholders and as a stepping stone towards FAIR data and essentially transparent, interoperable and sustainable knowledge.
